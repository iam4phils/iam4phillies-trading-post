      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        iam4phillies Trading Post is built for collectors who value accuracy, organization,
        and a clean browsing experience. Every card is cataloged using a deterministic,
        drift‑proof system designed to scale as new sets and years are added.
      </p>

      <h2>How the Site Works</h2>
      <p>
        The inventory browser loads card data directly from structured JSON files, ensuring
        fast performance and consistent formatting. Each card includes front and back images,
        pricing tiers, and optional eBay links for collectors looking to buy or compare.
      </p>

      <h2>Future Plans</h2>
      <p>
        More sets, more years, and more features are on the way. The goal is to create a
        comprehensive, reliable, and enjoyable resource for baseball card collectors of all kinds.
      </p>
